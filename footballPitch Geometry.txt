Football Pitch Geometry Overview

This document explains the geometry and layout of a standard football pitch rendered using SVG in a React component.

---

1. Canvas Size
- width: 800 pixels
- height: 500 pixels
- These dimensions define the drawing area for the entire football pitch.

---

2. Field Outline
- Drawn as a rectangle from (0, 0) to (800, 500)
- Represents the boundary of the pitch

---

3. Semi-Fields
- The pitch is visually divided by a center line
- centerX = width / 2 = 400
- The left and right halves represent each team's field side

---

4. Center Line
- A vertical line from (400, 0) to (400, 500)

---

5. Center Circle
- Center at (400, 250)
- Radius: 60px
- A small circle of radius 3px is also drawn at the center spot

---

6. Corner Arcs
- Radius: 12px
- Arcs are drawn at all four corners of the pitch using SVG path
- Top-left: Arc from (0, 12) to (12, 0)
- Top-right: Arc from (788, 0) to (800, 12)
- Bottom-left: Arc from (0, 488) to (12, 500)
- Bottom-right: Arc from (788, 500) to (800, 488)

---

7. Big Area (Penalty Area)
- Width: 120px
- Height: 300px
- Left side: starts at (0, 100)
- Right side: starts at (680, 100)

---

8. Small Area (Goal Box)
- Width: 40px
- Height: 160px
- Left side: starts at (0, 170)
- Right side: starts at (760, 170)

---

9. Goalposts
- Depth: 10px
- Height: 60px
- Left goal: drawn outside pitch from (-10, 220) to (0, 280)
- Right goal: drawn from (800, 220) to (810, 280)

---

10. Penalty Spots
- Radius: 3px
- Left penalty spot: (80, 250)
- Right penalty spot: (720, 250)

This geometry is scaled for a digital visualization, not a real-world size ratio, and can be mapped to normalized coordinates (0-100) for data overlays like formations, heatmaps, or shot locations.
