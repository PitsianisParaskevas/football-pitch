How Football Formation Rendering Works
This document explains how we render player formations on a football pitch using a dynamic geometry-based system. The logic supports symmetrical left-to-right (home team) and right-to-left (away team) positioning, customizable spacing, and consistent placement of the goalkeeper.

1. Formation Input Format
A formation is provided as a string like: "4-4-2", "4-2-3-1", "3-4-3", etc.

The formation describes the number of players per row, from defense to attack.

We automatically prepend the goalkeeper (1 player), making a full 11-player setup.

2. Team Direction
isHomeTeam = true: Team is rendered left ➝ right (GK at left end).

isHomeTeam = false: Team is rendered right ➝ left (GK at right end).

The team is rendered within their own half (semi-width of the field).

3. Geometry Logic
The field width is split into 2 halves:

Left for the home team

Right for the away team

We divide the semi-width into n areas, where n is the number of rows in the formation.

Players are placed centered in each area, spaced vertically with even padding.

Player x is calculated using:

js
Copy
Edit
x = startX + direction * (offsetX + i * areaWidth + areaWidth / 2) - playerWidth / 2
direction = 1 for home team, -1 for away team.

offsetX ensures horizontal centering within half-pitch.

4. Player Placement
Players in each row are stacked vertically.

y position is calculated by spacing them with equal gaps.

The first player is always the goalkeeper (isGK: true).

All other players are isGK: false.

5. Customization
formationWidthRatio: Adjusts how wide each formation spreads in their half.

teamColor, goalkeeperColor: Allows custom colors for each team or role.

6. Example
For formation="4-4-2" and isHomeTeam=true, the players are placed:

GK closest to the left goal

4 defenders, 4 midfielders, 2 strikers from back to front

For isHomeTeam=false, same formation mirrors from the right side.

This system ensures flexible, accurate formation visualization compatible with tactical views, match visualizations, or interactive lineups.
